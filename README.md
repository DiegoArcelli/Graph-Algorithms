# Graph-Algorithms
A list of some basic graph algorithms. Every folder contains an implementation of a certain set of graph algorithms:
* The BFS folder contains the implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS). It creates a random graph and it executes a breadth-first seach on it, starting from a arbitrary vertex. It also prints the tree generated by the visit.
* The DFS_SCC_TopologicalSort folder contains the implementation of three algorithms that use Depth-First Search (DFS):
  * The first creates a random graph and executes a depth-first search on it. Then it prints the path and the classification of every edge.
  * The second finds the strongly connected components of the previous graph by computing its transpose graph.
  * The third creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the previous graph and performs a topological sort on it.
* The Dijkstra_BellmanFord folder contains the implementation of two algorithms that solve the single source shortest path problem:
  * The first creates a random non negative weighted graph, it executes the Dijkstra's algorithm on it from an arbitrary vertex and then it prints the shortest paths.  
  * The second recomputes the weights of all the edges of the previous graph to make them even negative, then it executes the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the graph from an arbitrary vertex and it prints the shortest paths.
